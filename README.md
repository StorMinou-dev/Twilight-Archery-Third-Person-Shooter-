**Gameplay**  
This project is a cooperative third-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine.  
Two players control archers fighting together against a giant boss  
in a dedicated boss combat experience.  
We had to optimize the game to fit the Nintendo Switch specs.

**Boss**  
The boss is a giant mecha creature inspired by Godzilla.  
Its behavior is entirely driven by a Behavior Tree,  
allowing structured and readable AI logic.  
The boss reacts to player position by switching attacks  
in its arsenal.

**Attacks**  
We made an Attack class that each of the boss  
attacks inherits from.  
The boss features three distinct attacks :  
Laser – A quick beam attack

**Optimization (Nintendo Switch)**  
We needed the game to run smoothly on Nintendo Switch devices so we had  
to  give a special attention to performance optimization.  
This includes reducing game's quality, not using dynamic lights and shadows,  
and disabling tools such as lumen.

**Other Informations**  
This project was developed as a group project using Unreal Engine.  
All models, animations, and textures were sourced from third-party  
assets, including the Unreal Engine Asset Store and Mixamo.
